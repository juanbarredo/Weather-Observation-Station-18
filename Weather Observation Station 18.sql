--this new problem
--Weather Station 18 seems really interesting and hard

--I am excited to tackle it!

--today arrived my new keyboard.
--the CERAKEY typewritter.

--the keys are ceramic.

--it sounds so good

--it is also very much better ergonomically.


--my fingers are glinding better
--the numbers are easier to reach as well.

--love it.

--ok, problem Weather Observation Station 18.

--my wrists are burning.


--this ias a new keyboard.

----ok,
--one thing I just noticed.

--this problem is labeled as "medium"
--so let's calibrate to that.

--it makes me feel good to work on a problem like this one because it 
--feels very abstract.

--I am definitely going to be challenged.

--Consider p1(a,b) and p2(c,d)
--to be two points on a 2d plane.

--- a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude.
--- (LAT_N in STATION).

--- b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude.
--- (LONG_W in STATION).

--- c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude.
--- (LAT_N in STATION).

-- d happens to be the maximum value in Western Longitude.
--- (LONG_W in STATION).

--Query the Manattan Distance 
--between points p1 and p2
--and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

--wow, this problem is very, very interesting.

--Hamming Distance: The distance between two points measured along axes at right angles.
--In a plane with p1 at (x1,y1) and p2(x2,y2),
--it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

--ok, so here it laid out.

--I currently have no idea how to go about working on this one
--but I am very excited to figure it out!

--SELECT list: I have to figure out how to do absolute.
--list selections: i don't think there are many things that they are asking for list selections.  

--So, next time I will look up how to do absolute.
--
--seems that the Syntax is ABS ( numeric_expression )

--numeric_expression: an expression of the exact
--numeric or appropriate numeric data type category.

--doesn't look like it can do variables or column names at the moment.
